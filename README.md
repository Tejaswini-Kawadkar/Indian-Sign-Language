# Indian-Sign-Language
Designed a  two way communication system for ISL and non-ISL users. It helps to translate ISL to text and text to ISL effectively.

The Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translation System is designed to enhance communication between deaf and hearing individuals by using advanced Deep Learning and gesture recognition technology. This system translates ISL gestures into text and speech, and also converts text or spoken language back into animated ISL gestures.

The goal is to develop a robust two-way communication system that accurately translates between Indian Sign Language and text, enabling seamless communication between deaf-mute individuals and those who use spoken language, without the need for an external translator.

This system should be capable of:

*ISL to Text Translation: Convert hand gestures, captured via video, into corresponding textual information.*

*Text Translation: Text to speech, and other language.*

*Text to ISL Translation: Convert text input into corresponding ISL gestures, displayed as animations.*
